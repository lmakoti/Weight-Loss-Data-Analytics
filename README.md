## Overview

> My health has become a key priority in my life, and weight loss is at the top of my to-do list. The reason that prompted this realisation was the benefits I received from doing informal/untracked walks in the last quarter of 2021 and beginning of 2022, most of my walks were aimed at touring parts of London and appreciate this new place I now call home.
>
> I have decided to formalise my tracking and also modify my walking routines to include rucking which is a low intensity interval training workout that involves walking or hiking with a weighted rucksack (bag-pack) for a set distance.



## Rationale and definition

The theme described in the overview inspired me to do an analysis of my personal health and fitness and evaluate the progress ðŸ¤žðŸ˜‚ that I have made. The data is tracked from the **15 March 2022** (when I got my [Fitbit Charge 5](https://www.fitbit.com/global/uk/products/trackers/charge5?gclid=CjwKCAjwj42UBhAAEiwACIhADmoVq37g5FDdnkQb_A3GpXnVwAxkAp7_sVM9_h_jyt-eVn1rEH9C0RoC__gQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)) to the **03 August 2022**.



## Resources

The data comes from two primary sources: my Charge 5 and  [Rephno Smart Body Fat Scale](https://uk.renpho.com/products/smart-body-fat-scale-basic?variant=38203353891015)

1. **Fitbit Data**: Daily Distance from Activities

2. **Rephno Data**: Daily Weight Measurement (Incl. BMI)

3. **Basin18 North Face Rucksack**: Weight Carrier

## Solution Architecture

1. Link the Rephno scale to the Fitbit app, every measurement recorded in the app gets auto send to Fitbit

2. The data is collected/tracked in the Fitbit app

   <p align="center"><img src="Fibit Resources\fitbit_weight.jpeg" alt="fitbit_weight" style="height:350px" /></p>

3. Export the data from the Fitbit web-based dashboard as a CSV (**NB: **Data can only be exported in batches of 31 days, this is a bit inconvenient but PowerBI handles merging multiple files with relative ease)

4. Export the CSV files into a single working directory which will be used as a `folder data source` in PowerBI

5. The Fitbit data comes in well formatted and easily usable, only a few transformation steps were performed on the data
   - Filter to `Activity` data only i.e. exclude information on `body, foods and sleep` as highlighted in step 3 **NB**: the data can be filtered at export (Step 3)
   - Conversion to explicit data types (Decimal for numerical values)
   - Created a date column to conform to the set system date format `mm-dd-yyyy`



6. Create Report to represent the tracker metrics under focus (Initial Design)
